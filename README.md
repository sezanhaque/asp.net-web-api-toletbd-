# asp.net-web-api-toletbd-

This is a rental website like airbnb.
This is a web api. And the frontend is done with html, css, bootstrap and jquery.

We used jquery and ajax to get JSON data from the api.

To run this project you need minimum Visual Studio 2013. You can open this project with it and run.

As it is a web api so it does not have any VIEW so we created extra view here in the "FrontEnd" folder. Just copy this folder to your "XAMPP/WAMP" directory and run that application.
